
BUILDING FROM SOURCES
---------------------

You'll need the following:

	- JDK (Java Development Kit)
	- Apache ANT, http://ant.apache.org
	- (see "Platform-specific considerations" section below for additional)

Use Apache ANT to build the binding code from sources. 
The following command should build binaries and place them in 'tmp/dist'
folder:

ant build


TESTING THE DISTRIBUTION
------------------------

Use 'test' target to test the binding.

ant test


PLATFORM-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------

Windows:

	Place the following files, distributed with Morfeusz, in directory 
	"morfeusz":

		morfeusz.dll
		morfeusz.def
		morfeusz.h

	You will need MinGW suite (http://www.mingw.org/) installed.
	PATH variable should include 'bin' folder under MinGW's installation.

	More technically, g++ is used to compile the JNI code required for 
	Windows so it needs to be found on your PATH.
	
Linux:

	Place the following files, distributed with Morfeusz, in directory 
	"morfeusz":

		libmorfeusz.so
		morfeusz.h
		morfeusz.def
		
	All tests should now pass and the project should compile cleanly. Keep
	in mind that Linux runtime requires libraries to be stored somewhere where
	the runtime can find them (alternatively, use LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point
	to a folder where you have the binaries).
